The chapter two of the **‘Learning and knowledge’** document focusses on the learning and knowledge. The concern in curriculum development is to make it meaningful experience for children. There is a need to engage with the child centred education. The ability of a student to reproduce the textual knowledge should not be emphasized because they learn by getting in touch with the natural environment surrounding them. The interaction with the environment enables a children to construct knowledge. Children must be given opportunities to take initiatives. The curriculum should enable to nurture the student’s curiosity. The participation of children in sports, games is also mentioned in this chapter. But how many schools have playgrounds still remains a question and if they have it then do activities and games happen? Are the students motivated to participate in sports? And also, Do students really participate in classroom discussions? The document focusses on curriculum to develop a holistic approach to learning and child development.
